Mavericks users may have some interesting issues here: 

  -  Have you installed xcode's Command Line Tools since upgrading?
  -  SQLite3 can cause problems. running `brew reinstall sqlite` then set the shell variables it suggests as so (replace as necessary):
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"
     Then do `gem uninstall sqlite3` and `bundle install` again
